## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
python virus_scan.py [target] --os [operating_system]
```

Examples:
```bash
# Scan a single file
python virus_scan.py suspicious_file.exe --os win

# Scan a directory
python virus_scan.py /path/to/directory --os linux --debug

# Scan a zip archive
python virus_scan.py archive.zip --os mac

# Use only ClamAV
python virus_scan.py file.exe --os win --clamav-only

# Display help information
python virus_scan.py --readme
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `target`: File, directory, or zip archive to scan
- `--os`: Target operating system (win, mac, linux, android)
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging
- `--clamav-only`: Use only ClamAV for scanning
- `--readme`: Display detailed program information

## Enhanced Features

### Code Analysis
- Line and column numbers for detected issues
- Code snippets showing concerns
- Detailed explanations of potential threats
- Google search links for additional information

### Zip File Handling
- Safe extraction of compressed files
- Handles problematic file names
- Temporary directory management
- Recursive scanning of contents

### Multiple Integration Options
- YARA Rules for custom pattern matching
- NVD for known vulnerability checking
- ClamAV for traditional antivirus scanning

## Log Files

The scanner creates two types of log files:

1. Debug Log (debug_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log):
   - Created with --debug flag
   - Contains detailed scanning process information

2. Scan Results Log (virus_scan_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log):
   - Created upon request after scan completion
   - Contains comprehensive scan results

## Risk Categories

- HIGH: Critical security threats requiring immediate attention
- MEDIUM: Potential security risks that should be reviewed
- LOW: Minor concerns or informational findings
